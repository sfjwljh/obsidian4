Some critics point out that advertising is nothing more than a waste of money and social resources,full of exaggerated self-promotion,thus suggesting that companies should save the money and reduce the price.
However,contrary to many anti-advertisement consumers' intuitionï¼Œadvertisements not only lower the price,but add more color to our daily routine.After all,selling goods isn't the only purpose of advertising.For instance,basic information of household goods are easily accessed ,saving us the time of choosing which one to buy.Take an imagination of a world without advertisements,how bored will it be when walking down the long passageway of metro stations and airports.Moreover,habits like reading newspaper and watching television will become costly int that the giant revenue of advertisements no longer exists.Removing commercial ads merely makes newspaper more expensive,but removing small ads such as the "hatch,match,dispatch" and "agony" column will  sacrifice the most useful and entertaining part of newspaper.In summery,the current situation is ,that we are enjoying the benefits of advertisements everyday without realizing it.
